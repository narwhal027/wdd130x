        <p>My name is Logan Hansen. My major is in Software Engineering. My main career goal is to work from home and make platformer video games, simlar to hollow knight.</p>
        <p>I have several hobbies, among them are crocheting and resin, though I've been experimenting with chainmail. I enjoy DND and MTG, so pretty much everything nerdy.</p>
        <p>I've been with the church for my entire life, and i'm excited to be in a college with a spiritual environment.</p>
